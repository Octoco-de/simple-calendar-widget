## Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Xcode 15 or later
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)

## Build & Run

1. **Install XcodeGen** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Octoco-de/simple-calendar-widget.git
   cd simple-calendar-widget
   ```

3. **Generate the Xcode project**:

   ```bash
   xcodegen generate
   ```

4. **Open in Xcode**:

   ```bash
   open SimpleCalendarWidget.xcodeproj
   ```

5. **Set your development team**:

   In Xcode, select the **SimpleCalendarWidget** project in the navigator, then for both the **SimpleCalendarWidget** and **CalendarWidgetExtension** targets, go to **Signing & Capabilities** and select your development team.

6. **Build and run**:

   Select the **SimpleCalendarWidget** scheme, then press **Cmd+R**. The host app window will appear.

7. **Add the widget**:

   Right-click your desktop → **Edit Widgets** → search for **"Simple Calendar"** → drag the widget onto your desktop.

## Configuration

Click the widget → **Edit Widget** to configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Start Day of Week** | Which day appears in the first column (default: Sunday) |
| **Month Offset** | Shift from current month: -1 = previous, 0 = current, +1 = next |
| **Show Adjacent Days** | Show/hide days from previous and next month in empty grid cells (default: on) |

### Three-month setup

Add three widgets and set their month offsets to **-1**, **0**, and **+1** to see the previous, current, and next month side by side.

## Project Structure

The `.xcodeproj` is generated by XcodeGen from `project.yml` and is not committed to the repository.

```
project.yml                              # XcodeGen project spec (source of truth)
SimpleCalendarWidget/                    # Host app (minimal)
  SimpleCalendarWidgetApp.swift
CalendarWidgetExtension/                 # Widget extension
  CalendarWidget.swift                   # Widget entry point
  CalendarIntent.swift                   # Configuration (start day, month offset)
  CalendarTimelineProvider.swift         # Timeline provider (refreshes at midnight)
  CalendarGridView.swift                 # SwiftUI month grid view
  CalendarWidgetEntry.swift              # Data models
  MonthCalculator.swift                  # Calendar computation logic
